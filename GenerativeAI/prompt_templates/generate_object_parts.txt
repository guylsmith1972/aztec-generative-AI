REQUEST: Create a JSON object that describes the materials, components, locations, and features of an anvil (a heavy metal block with a flat top used for shaping metal).
Materials are raw materials that are shaped into a component. If a component is listed, do not list the materials for that component.
Components are pieces that are crafted and assembled into the anvil.
Locations are named places on the anvil.
Features are shaped parts of an existing part of the anvil.
